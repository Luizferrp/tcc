[Resumo](#resumo)
---
this uses a autoenconder with a SVM
offers the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL) to serve as outlier detection for zero-day attacks with high recall
autoencoder acts as a light-weight outlier detector, which could then be used for zero-day attacks detection,




Citations:
 - The increase in both the number and sheer variety of new cyber-attacks poses a tremendous challenge for IDS solutions that rely on a database of historical attack signatures
 - Current outlier-based zero-day detection research suffers from high false-negative rates
 - Their findings showed that a zero-day attack can exist for a substantial period of time (average of 10 months) before they are detected and can compromise systems during that period
 - statistical study that shows that 62% of the attacks are identified after compromising systems.
 - Moreover, the number of zero-day attacks in 2019 exceeds the previous three years
 - urgent need for more effective attack detection models
