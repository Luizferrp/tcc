[Resumo]
The study evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in detecting cybersecurity attacks targeting IoT devices using the CIC-IoT2023 dataset. The researchers compared four ML models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The results demonstrated that Decision Tree and Random Forest significantly outperformed other algorithms, achieving accuracy rates over 99%. The study provides valuable insights for selecting appropriate ML algorithms for IoT security implementation.
