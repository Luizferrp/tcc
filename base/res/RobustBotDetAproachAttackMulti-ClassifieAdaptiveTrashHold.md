[Resumo]
The paper presents a novel methodology for detecting both known and unknown attacks in IoT networks. For known attacks, it uses a stacked multi-classifier trained with classwise features, utilizing LGMLVQ for feature selection in imbalanced classes. For unknown attacks, it employs a shallow autoencoder with adaptive reconstruction error thresholding. The approach showed exceptional performance with 99.9952% accuracy for known attacks and strong metrics for unknown attack detection.
