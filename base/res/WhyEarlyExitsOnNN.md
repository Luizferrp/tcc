[Resumo]
The paper provides a comprehensive introduction to neural networks with multiple early exits. These architectures allow for obtaining predictions at intermediate points of the neural network, rather than waiting for the full network to be processed. The paper discusses key challenges and opportunities related to the optimized design, training, and implementation of these multi-exit neural networks, including placement of auxiliary classifiers, different training strategies, and inference phase optimization.
