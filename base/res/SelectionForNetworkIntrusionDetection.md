[Resumo]
Network Intrusion Detection (NID) remains a key area of research within the information security community, while also being relevant to Machine Learning (ML) practitioners. The paper presents a novel information-theoretic method called FSNID that addresses limitations in existing feature selection methods, particularly in handling highly correlated features and temporal dependencies. The method uses a transfer entropy-based measure of feature importance and demonstrates significant reduction in feature set size while maintaining classification performance.
