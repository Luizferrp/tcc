[Resumo]
The paper proposes a framework for "safe" early-exiting in neural networks using statistical frameworks of risk control. The authors address the efficiency vs. performance trade-off by defining two types of risks: performance gap risk and consistency risk. They adapt conformal risk control (CRC) and upper confidence bound (UCB) frameworks to provide guarantees on controlling these risks. The approach is validated across various tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, language modeling, image generation, and speculative decoding, showing substantial computational savings while maintaining user-specified performance goals.
