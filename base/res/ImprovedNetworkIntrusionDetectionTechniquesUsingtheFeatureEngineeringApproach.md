[Resumo]
The study presents a comprehensive approach to network intrusion detection using feature engineering and machine learning. The methodology includes preprocessing techniques, correlation analysis, custom label encoding, and a novel feature scaling algorithm. The research evaluates multiple classifiers through 10-fold cross-validation, achieving high accuracy rates. The XGBoost model showed the best overall performance among the tested algorithms.
